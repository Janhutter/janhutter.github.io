### Information Retrieval
- [**Lost but Not Only in the Middle: Positional Bias in Retrieval Augmented Generation**](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-88708-6_16) \
  A systematic analysis of positional bias in RAG, showing that the position of retrieved documents significantly impacts the quality of generated responses. \

### UvA courses
During my Master's at the University of Amsterdam, I have contributed to 3 papers that were part of course projects. Each of these were publication ready, but were not submitted to any conferences or journals.

Vision-Language Models**]({{ site.baseurl }}/other_papers/foundation_models_course.pdf)
- [**[RE] Are Your Models Still Fair? Fairness Attacks on Graph
Neural Networks via Node Injections**]({{ site.baseurl }}/other_papers/fact_course.pdf)
