### What is WooGLe?
<a href="https://woogle.wooverheid.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>WooGLe</b></a> is a search engine designed specifically for Dutch "Woo-dossiers" â€” documents made public following requests under the "Wet open overheid" (Woo, Open Government Act). 
The primary goal of WooGLe is to enhance the accessibility and usefulness of government information. It serves as a single platform where all documents requested under the Woo are easily accessible. More on WooGLe (in Dutch) <a href="https://woogle.wooverheid.nl/about">here</a>

### What Have I Been Working On?
We want to improve the WooGLe search functionality using AI techniques. To achieve this, we have tested multiple dense and sparse retrieval systems, to measure their effectiveness across the quite diverse range of Woo documents.\
In addition, we created a <a href="https://chat.wooverheid.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">retrieval augmented chatbot</a>, powered by a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM). Because of these two implementations, users will be able to acquire the correct documents more quickly and efficiently.
