### What is WooGLe?
**WooGLe** is a search engine designed specifically for Dutch "Woo-dossiers" — documents made public following requests under the "Wet open overheid" (Woo, Open Government Act). 
The primary goal of WooGLe is to enhance the accessibility and usefulness of government information. It serves as a single platform where all documents requested under the Woo are easily accessible. More on WooGLe (in Dutch) <a href="https://woogle.wooverheid.nl/about">here</a>
